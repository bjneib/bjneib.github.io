            <h3>Coast Tour</h3>
            <p>
                Mexico’s largest inhabited island, Cozumel boasts pristine Caribbean beaches and spectacular coral life.
                On this exclusive jungle and snorkeling tour, you’ll get a taste of the island’s ancient culture and
                natural beauty behind the wheel of your own private jeep—with time to savor local delicacies. Maximize
                your visit by covering all the island's must-see sites in one visit.
                Meet your guide in your hotel lobby and, at the wheel of your own jeep, follow your guide to ancient
                Mayan settlements and a coral-filled underwater park. Your guide will fill you in on the powerful
                civilization that once ruled over the area before you hit the beach.

                Cozumel’s colorful corals are part of the world’s second largest barrier reef. Strap on a snorkeling
                mask for a first-hand look at the island’s stunning marine scenery. You’ll have time to lounge on
                Cozumel’s eastern sand beaches, famous for their warm turquoise waters, and enjoy an authentic lunch
                before returning to your hotel.

                You can also customize your itinerary to include optional upgrades like visits to San Gervasio
                archaeological site and Punta Sur National Park, or activities like scuba diving, horseback riding,
                parasailing, or swimming with dolphins. <a style="color: #823038;"

            <h3>Ruins Tour</h3>
            <p>
                Discover the ancient history of Mexico on a day trip from Cozumel to the archaeological site of Tulum.
                On a ferry to the mainland, take in views of the coastline that most visitors never get to experience.
                Once at Tulum, your guide gives context to unmarked points of interest that are easy to miss if visiting
                on your own. Lunch, transportation, and admission tickets are included.Meet your tour operator at a pier
                in downtown Cozumel, where you board a ferry bound for mainland Mexico. After a pleasant ride with
                coastal views rarely seen by visitors, arrive in Playa del Carmen. An air-conditioned minivan brings you
                directly to the gates of Tulum.

                Follow your guide on a walking tour of the ancient city perched on an oceanside cliff. Going with a
                guide ensures you understand the layout of the archaeological site and don’t miss any unmarked points of
                interest. Pause for photos of the temples and castles with a backdrop of the Caribbean Sea.

                After your tour, enjoy lunch with the group and then head back to Playa del Carmen to catch the ferry.
                Finish the day with a relaxing ride back to Cozumel. <a style="color: #823038;"
